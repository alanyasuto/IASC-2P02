## Bio

I am a fourth year student in the IASC program at Brock University. My research areas are Modernist Journals Project,academic post and researches for amohibious vehicles, and my research program involves doing PowerPoint and academic researches with text analysis tools. This research focus is reflected in my projects in this portoflio, such as project a that looks at b. Similarly, project c looks at d. I'd like to continue with this work in the future by doing x.


## Featured Project: [Amphibious Vehicle: The History and Future for Boat-cars]

I also made these changes, which you can see [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02/commit/a778e6e587cb17d99e430e18bae3e4e0d0d128b5). I also made these changes, which you can see [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02/commit/2a63e808d7e977fbf58a29a5626189876dbf1934). Overall these changes show x and y changes in my thinking.


## Collaborative Project:Modernist Journals Project

The Modernist Journals Project(MJP) is a multi-faceted project that aims to be a major resource for the study of modernism and its rise in the English-speaking world, with periodical literature as its central concern. The historical scope of the project has a chronological range of 1890 to 1922, and a geographical range that extends to wherever English language periodicals were published. With magazines at its core, the MJP also offers a range of genres that extends to the digital publication of books directly connected to modernist periodicals and other supporting materials for periodical study.

For this group project, we contributed our works on the Google drive and we contact each other by sending emails. I found related information and putted them together in the Powerpoint for each slides. I approach collaboration in many ways, which is reflected in the Introduction (available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K_w0ljlTMxzwfYLaGKy1qS0yovBPPB5DO-beAu8LsIs/edit#slide=id.g4eb4df3e41_0_119)). I also approach collaboration in another ways, which is reflected in Initial Reserach and Findings (available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K_w0ljlTMxzwfYLaGKy1qS0yovBPPB5DO-beAu8LsIs/edit#slide=id.g4ed3d71a8f_0_55)).
