## Prompt:As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientific approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!

Digital humanities are an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with the intersection of knowledge management, computer science, and a range of humanities disciplines (Steiner et al, 2014, p. 53). Digital humanities “involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form,” (Kirschenbaum). Many cultural heritage collections have been made available online, because of recent large-scale digitisations initiatives. However, like other sciences, digital humanities are a “social undertaking” with networks of people working together and sharing their research, arguing, competing, and collaborating (Kirschenbaum). It deals with the idea of collecting information in an effort for a better understanding. It is a way to provide more insight into the areas of interest. 

Science involves the use of observations, because the idea is to look at an object and then make some conclusions about it based on experiments and observations. Digital humanities utilise the use of digital technologies in the humanities industry. It is a field of research that is dedicated to the possibilities of computing in social sciences and humanities. Studies conducted in art, communication, literature, linguistics, political science, and anthropology, can be furthered through the use of computing and this is what the field plans to do. Although it seems like science and humanities cannot be linked or are incompatible are failing to identify the overall potential uses in the field. 

Through a range of approaches, such as new models of distant reading, the use of network theory to help examine historical events, algorithmic literary criticisms, the use of social media or networked platforms in the classroom, digital analysis and encoding of manuscripts, and incorporation of geospatial data into projects. These approaches can work to identify key aspects of many sources. When considering this idea, one can determine that the humanities approach which is subjective can be enhanced and analysed by scientific approaches. It allows for traditional activities in the field to be reshaped by new methods that are possible with data-driven inquiry. A systematic approach to the use of digital technologies used in the field has the potential to create extensive knowledge on the subject and goes beyond where the discipline has gone in the past.

Digital humanities focus on acting as a bridge between these two contrasting disciplines to help create new avenues for the study of humanities. It can work to enhance the traditional humanities research through digital means and provides a way for the traditional learning to be redefined. Whether digital humanities are a discipline of its own or an emerging discipline, it is more than just digitising the resources. There is an analysis that is included in the process, which makes it more like a science than something that is purely based on perceptions. Although science is based on facts, there are some aspects of science that walk a line between a fact and an observation. Science aims to identify the facts, but much of the data that is presented relies on observations and interpretations of the results, which is more of a subjective approach.

The idea is that humanities and science have a lot more in common. They both entail the use of observations and collected data sets. Digital humanities aim to implement more of the digital technologies into the study of humanities, which can help to provide a better understanding and allow for a deeper analysis of the results and observations. The process can strengthen our knowledge and identify key aspects that go beyond what is currently offered in many of these disciplines. Ramsay (nd) identifies that the use of rhetoric or persuasion is “antithetical to the search for truth,” or opposing (p. 18). Therefore, through the use of scientific measures and studies, the truth regarding aspects relating the humanities will need to be approached in a different way.

Although the idea is that science and humanities are simply different disciplines that are too opposed to be utilised together, the idea that a scientific approach through the use of digital technologies is one that is viable. It can provide more adequate data that is based on more reliable information. It is the interpretation of this data and the information gathered that will lead to a better understanding and embrace ideals that have yet to be present in the humanity concentrations. There seems to be a contrast in the ideologies present, but this is not the case. The use of these digital technologies in the field of humanities, is something that will provide solid data that can be readily interpreted to provide a greater understanding of key topics in the various fields.
